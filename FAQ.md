Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**Q** What does a spectroscope's resolution of "R 1000" mean?

**A** The resolution is the reference wavelength divided by the bandpass of interest.
Example:   

* At 5000 angstroms, what is the R value sufficient to resolve 1 Angstroms?

    * 5000/1 = R 5000
 
* For the V-Band photometric filter, centered at 5448 Angstroms with a bandpass of 840 Angstroms?

    * 5000/840 = 5.9 or about R 6.
 
To answer the bandpass of 1000 Angstroms at a wavelength of 5000 Angstroms, divide 5000 by 1000 for the answer of 5 angstroms of resolution.

**Q** What velocity does a resolution of 5 angstroms (R 1000 spectrograph) translate into:

**A** The change in wavelength divided by wavelength is equal to the velocity divided by the speed of light. 
* 5 [A] / 1000 [A] = v [km s-1] / 3e5 [km s-1]. The notation of [units] mixes the units of the formula into the values. Note the units completely cancel; the next step is then:
    * 5 / 1000 = v / 3e5
    
    * 5 * 3e5 / 1e3 
    
    * 5 * 3e2 = 1500 km s-1. 
    
    Not exactly radial velocity speeds.
